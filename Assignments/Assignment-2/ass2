IF-THEN-ELSE in ARM Assembly ::
Cortex-M4 processors support conditional branches, as well as conditional execution of instructions by putting the conditional 
instructions in an IF-THEN (IT) instruction block.
By updating the APSR using data operations, or TST (test) or compare (CMP), the program flow can be controlled  based on conditions of 
operation.

Suffixes for Conditional Execution are EQ,NE,LT,GE,GT,LE,MI,PL,VC,VS,HI,LS,CC,CS.

The IT (If-Then) instruction has the following syntax:
                                                      IT{x{y{z}}} {cond}
where:
x    : specifies the condition switch for the second instruction in the IT block.
y    : specifies the condition switch for the third instruction in the IT block.
z    : specifies the condition switch for the fourth instruction in the IT block.
cond : specifies the condition for the first instruction in the IT block.
After an IT (IF-THEN) instruction is executed, up to four of the subsequent instructions can be conditionally executed based on the 
condition specified by the IT instruction and the APSR value.
The conditional execution instructions can be data processing instructions or memory access instructions.

The condition switch for the second, third and fourth instruction in the IT block can be either:
T-Then. Applies the condition 'cond' to the instruction.
E-Else. Applies the inverse condition of cond to the instruction.

Restrictions when using an IT block are:
You cannot use any assembler directives in an IT block.
(The assembler shows a diagnostic message when any of these instructions are used in an IT block).

IT Instruction does not change the flags.

For Example:
------------
 PSEUDO CODE  --------------->   ASSEMBLY CODE
if (r0 > r1) {   ------>        cmp r0,r1 ;set flags
                                ITTEE GT ;condition 4 instr
add r2,r3,r4    ------->        addgt r2,r3,r4 ;do if r0>r1
sub r3,r4,r5    ------->        subgt r3,r4,r5 ;do if r0>r1
} else {                                     
and r2,r3,r4    ------->        andle r2,r3,r4 ;do if r0<=r1
orr r3,r4,r5    ------->        orrle r3,r4,f5 ;do if r0<=r1
}

Example 2:
------------
    ADDSNE r2,r2,#1  ; 32-bit ADDS (16-bit ADDS does not set flags in IT block)
    MOVEQ  r2,r3     ; 16-bit MOV
    ADD    r0,r0,r1  ; expands into 32-bit ADD, and is not in IT block    // syntax error: no condition code used in IT block
 Hence ADD instruction following IF-THEN-ELSE condition in pseudo code can't be equivalent to ADD in assembly language, 
but ADDEQ/ADDLT/ADDGE etc..

So, ultimately the conditions that if/then should follow in an IT instrucction should be such that they shouldn't set any flags.
Hence in the given CODE-1 , Keil simulator shows the error message "Specified condition is not consistent with previous IT". But in the 
CODE-2, ITTTE is followed by ADDLT,MOVLT,SUBGE instructions.Thus, eliminating the errors.
