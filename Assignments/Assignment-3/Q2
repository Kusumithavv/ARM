Normal and Subnormal  Values as per IEEE 754  standards:
----------------------------------------------------------
NORMAL NUMBER:
--------------
For a particular format, a finite non-zero floating-point number with magnitude >= minimum b^emin value, where b is the radix. 
In this standard, zero is neither normal nor subnormal. 

SUBNORMAL NUMBER:
-----------------
In a particular format, a non-zero floating-point number with magnitude < magnitude of that format’s smallest normal number. 
A subnormal number does not use the full precision whereas, normal numbers use.
Floating-point data representaion:            (−1)^sign ×(b)^exponent × (significand)
                                   where b :  b = the radix, 2 or 10 
                                         p = the number of digits in the significand (precision) 
                                         emax = the maximum exponent e 
                                         emin = the minimum exponent e & emin = (1 − emax) for all formats. 
Signed zero and non-zero floating-point numbers of the form (−1)^s × b^e × m,
where,  s is 0 or 1
        e is any integer emin ≤ e ≤ emax
        m is a number represented by a digit string of the form d0 • d1 d2…dp −1 ; di is an integer digit 0 ≤ di < b (therefore 0 ≤ m < b).

The smallest positive normal floating-point number is b emin and the largest is (b^emax)*(b − b^(1− p)). 
The non-zero floating-point numbers for a format with magnitude < (b^emin) are called subnormal because their magnitudes lie between zero
and the smallest normal magnitude. They always have fewer than p significant digits.
Every finite floating-point number is an integral multiple of the smallest subnormal magnitude b^emin × b^(1−p).
