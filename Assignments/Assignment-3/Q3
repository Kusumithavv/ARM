                            IEEE 754 standards for Rounding Floating point numbers
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROUNDING-DIRECTION ATTRIBUTES :
Rounding takes a number regarded as infinitely precise and, if necessary, modifies it to fit in the destination’s format.
There are separate rounding-direction attributes for binary and decimal, the binary rounding direction and the decimal rounding direction. 

Rounding-direction attributes to nearest :
------------------------------------------
There are two rounding-direction attributes, an infinitely precise result with magnitude round to ∞ with no change in sign.
--> roundTiesToEven: 
the floating-point number nearest to the infinitely precise result shall be delivered; 
if the two nearest floating-point numbers bracketing an unrepresentable infinitely precise result are equally near, the one with an even 
least significant digit shall be delivered.
                    Ex: 3.7 is rounded off to 4.0

--> roundTiesToAway: 
the floating-point number nearest to the infinitely precise result shall be delivered;
if the two nearest floating-point numbers bracketing an unrepresentable infinitely precise result are equally near, the one with larger 
magnitude shall be delivered.
                    Ex: 3.7 is rounded off to 3.0
				                5.7  is rounded off to 6.0


Directed rounding attributes :
------------------------------
User-selectable rounding-direction attributes are defined:

--> roundTowardPositive : the result shall be the format’s floating-point number (possibly +∞) closest to and no less than the infinitely
precise result
                      Ex: 3.5 is rounded off to 4.0  ,  3.9 is rounded off to 4.0
--> roundTowardNegative : the result shall be the format’s floating-point number (possibly −∞) closest to and no greater than the 
infinitely precise result 
                       Ex: 3.5 is rounded off to 3.0 ,   3.9 is rounded off to 4.0

--> roundTowardZero     : the result shall be the format’s floating-point number closest to and no greater in magnitude than the infinitely
precise result.
               Ex: 7.5 is rounded off to 7.0   ,	7.9 is rounded off to 7.0
